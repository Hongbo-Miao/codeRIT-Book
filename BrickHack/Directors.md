#Directors

Directors are not required to be hackers, programmers, or of technical studies. We have found this to be a common misconception. Anyone can be a director if they wish.

Directors of BrickHack committees([Logistics](Logistics.md), [Sponsorship](Sponsorship.md), [Marketing](Marketing.md), and [Travel](Travel.md)) are not routinely involved with the everyday operations of [codeRIT](../codeRIT/codeRIT.md). This would be a huge undertaking and not go well.

Directors lead teams that make [BrickHack](BrickHack.md) the success it has been in the past! There are mandatory, open, weekly director sync-ups in order to make sure things are going smoothly and everyone is on the same page. This allows all directors to have an accurate synopsis or various committees they might not be involved in. Organizing is a collective cohesive effort and the weekly director sync-ups are the metaphorical glue that adheres the committees together.

Assigning directors is an internal procedure. Directors agree on, and then train, their replacements. Most of these directors have either served on a committee or organized events in the past. These trainees are frequently new, active, contributing, or passionate members! They ensure the longevity of BrickHack through participation and organization.
