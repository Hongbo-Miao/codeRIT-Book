# Logistics

The directors of Logistics are why events run so smoothly! By the week of the event, the Logistics Team has fine-tuned all crucial event operations. They truly are the [**Superstars of Event Planning**](../Resources/Resources.md#Organization/Collaboration)!

The Logistics Team deliberates on many crucial details for events such as...

* Meals

* Volunteers

* Venue

  although a lot of time and thought goes into just these three categories, there are countless other event operation requirements handled by our proactive logistics team.(Will expanded on specifics in coming community revisions)

If you have a keen eye for practicality, fine details, and catch what some seem to glance over or forget; you would probably love logistics! It is ideal for the self-motivated problem-solvers as well as people who would like the opportunity to learn and enhance these vital organizational skills.
