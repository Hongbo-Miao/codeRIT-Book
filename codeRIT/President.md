# President

It is the duty of the President to maintain the organization's inclusive and accessible principles.

The President frequently organizes codeRIT community events (excluding [BrickHack](../BrickHack/BrickHack.md)) with the rest of the e-board. This includes anything from open [Hacktorials](Resources/Resources.md#Channels), weekly sync-ups with the e-board, and the occasional hacknight.
