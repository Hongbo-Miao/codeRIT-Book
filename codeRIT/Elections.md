#Elections

codeRIT elections are reliant on [community](../Resources/Resources.md#Community) participation.

The four e-board positions ([President](President.md), [Vice President](VicePresident.md), [Secretary](Secretary.md), [Treasurer](Treasurer.md) are to be elected, after a brief campaigning period, collectively by the community members. This should be a public and democratic process.



## Continuity

For continuity's sake, In the case of an unexpected departure or a lack of candidates,  a current e-board member may fill a high priority vacancy when needed. In this case the e-board should elect a community member to the newly vacated position.
