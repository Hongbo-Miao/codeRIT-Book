# Vice President

Along with the President, the Vice President's main function is to continue the operations of the organization.

The Vice President often plays a large role in organizing codeRIT community events (excluding [BrickHack](../BrickHack/BrickHack.md)) with the rest of the e-board. This includes anything from open [Hacktorials](Resources/Resources.md#Channels), weekly sync-ups with the e-board, and the occasional hacknight.
